I want to try everything. Make and do as many things that I find enjoyable. 
I study Computer Science but have many interests.
Experience is something I value a lot so I strive towards it!
Trying to put passion in many interests is hard and choosing where to give your time is even harder, but 
I think it is worth the time to find your true passion.

I study Computer Science but have many other interests.
Trying to make and do many different things to make 
experiences and find new skills I enjoy and value. 
Crafting and making challenges me and my limits.
Constant discomfort I get from it widens my perspective 
and heightens appreciation to different skills.
